  <h4 id="general">What are the basic rules of the tournament?</h4>
  <p>
    Use your common sense: don't hack into the game servers, don't deliberately
    corrupt or leak memory or otherwise try to crash or hang up the game, don't
    abuse the RNG, and don't be a jerk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anything within the normal execution of NetHack is fair game. This includes
    farming, scumming, abusing program bugs, reading other characters' dumplogs,
    viewing ttyrecs of your own or others' games, using interface enhancers like
    InterHack, and hanging out on IRC to see if the gray stone you picked up in
    Mines' End gets livelogged as the luckstone.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're pursuing a strategy that could result in you dying a lot of times
    on bones-eligible levels, such as digging for victory or fountain scumming,
    please make sure to set !bones in your rc file as a courtesy to other
    players so that you don't leave useless bones and throw away other players'
    interesting bones on your way down.
  </p>
  <h4 id="bots">Can I run a bot?</h4>
  <p>
    Bots are prohibited. TNNT is a tournament for human players, not a
    competition for the best or luckiest bot. Players found to be running a bot
    may be summarily banned from the tournament.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our working definition of a bot is any system that automatically evaluates
    game state and makes gameplay decisions. Thus, pasting macros is fine, but
    running a startscum script that quits the game if your inventory, stats, or
    surroundings do not meet certain criteria is not.
  </p>
  <h4 id="version">Why isn't TNNT based on NetHack 3.7 yet?</h4>
  <p>
    TNNT is still based on NetHack 3.6.7 because it's the current stable release
    of NetHack. While we would love to base it on 3.7, we are waiting for it to
    be officially released. Basing it on the development version would mean
    picking a random cut-off point in development that might have major bugs or
    game balance issues, and we want to minimize the risk of something like that
    being discovered during TNNT and having to make a choice whether to patch it
    or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, porting it to recent 3.7-dev would mean that a second porting effort
    would have to be done in the future when 3.7 does actually get released, or
    even every year if we end up creating the expectation that new features from
    the development version will be available in TNNT. It's not something we
    want to commit to.
  </p>
  <h4 id="extracontent">What's this message/level/object I never encountered before?</h4>
  <p>
    TNNT contains a couple additional challenges which add a few new things to
    the game, so if you encounter something unfamiliar, it's probably one of
    those. Interacting with them is not required to win the game. However, there
    are a few achievements for completing these challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid spoiling players that are new to TNNT, the things we added to the
    game have been purposely omitted from this site. For those that wish to
    spoil themselves about all of the new game content in TNNT, please visit the
    TNNT entry on the
    <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_November_NetHack_Tournament" target="_blank">
      NetHack Wiki
    </a>.
  </p>
  <h4 id="clans">What's a clan? How does it work?</h4>
  <p>
    A clan is a group of players working together to achieve goals that could be
    difficult for a lone player to achieve by themselves, such as
    multi-ascension trophies. Most statistics tracked for players are also
    pooled together and tracked for clans, allowing clans to compete directly
    against each other (but not against players). You don't have to join a clan,
    but it's often fun to be in one!
  </p>
  <p>
    To create clans, invite players to your clan, and accept invitations to
    others' clans,
    {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
      please <a href="/login">log in</a>.
    {% else %}
      go <a href="/clanmgmt">here</a>.
    {% endif %}
  </p>
  <p>
    Clan size is capped at 12, and a clan is not allowed to have more than 12
    pending invitations. The tournament is designed so that adding new clan
    members, however inexperienced, cannot hurt the clan overall (this is why we
    don't track a clan's overall ascension ratio, for instance).
  </p>
  <p>
    On November 10th at 00:00 UTC, clan membership will become frozen;
    people can still leave or be kicked out of clans, but cannot create new
    clans or join new clans.
  </p>
  <h4 id="achievements">What are these "achievement" things?</h4>
  <p>
    Achievements are small in-game accomplishments you can collect for yourself
    and your clan, which vary in difficulty from pretty easy to very
    challenging. You can use the #achievements command during a game to view
    which ones are and aren't completed. The #tnntstats command is also useful
    for viewing progress towards certain achievements.
  </p>
  <p>
    To see a list of all achievements and what is required to earn them,
    navigate to your player or clan page, or view
    <a href="/achievements">all achievements by the number of people who
      achieved them</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 id="commands">Do I need to manually keep track of my progress towards achievements?</h4>
  <p>
    Nope. Several in-game extended commands are provided to let you view your
    progress on such things. These commands are:
    <ul>
      <li>#achievements: shows achievements you have and haven't earned.</li>
      <li>
        #tnntstats: a listing of TNNT-related goals, mostly related to
        achievements that require you to do a certain number of things. Some of
        them may not be shown until they become relevant.
      </li>
      <li>#snacks: shows all foods eaten.</li>
      <li>#species: shows all eligible species killed and not killed.</li>
      <li>#conduct: shows TNNT conducts in addition to vanilla ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4 id="trophies">What are trophies?</h4>
  <p>
    Various accomplishments across one or multiple games earn you trophies. To
    see how to earn these, go to the <a href="/trophies">Trophies page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the trophies can also be earned collectively by a clan. If an individual
    earns one of these trophies on their own, their clan will also get the
    trophy.
  </p>
  <h4 id="changes">What does it mean for trophies if I change gender or alignment?</h4>
  <p>
    For trophy purposes, the gender or alignment you ended the game with doesn't
    matter, only the starting one. Consequently, you can't deliberately change
    your alignment on a race/role/alignment combo you already played to get the
    game to count as a different one.
  </p>
  <h4 id="missing">Why aren't there role trophies for Knight, Samurai, or Tourist?</h4>
  <p>
    There's no such thing as the Great (or Lesser) Knight, Samurai, or Tourist
    because only a single race and alignment combination can be played with
    these roles, so you would only need a single game to accomplish them. They
    do count towards the Great and Lesser Human trophies.
  </p>
  <h4 id="lesser">What does "Complete Mines and Soko" mean for the Lesser trophies?</h4>
  <p>
    For the Lesser Race/Role trophies, you must complete a game with each
    required character combination where you successfully pick up the luckstone
    from the bottom of the Mines <strong>AND</strong> pick up the prize from
    the end of Sokoban. That's all the game needs to qualify &mdash; it doesn't
    matter if the game ends in death afterwards, and you don't need to escape
    the dungeon with those prizes.
  </p>
  <h4 id="notboth">Why didn't I get the Lesser trophy when I got the Greater one?</h4>
  <p>
    Achieving a Great Race or Role does not necessarily imply that you also
    deserve the same Lesser Race or Role, since it is possible to ascend without
    completing Sokoban and/or retrieving the Mines' End luckstone. If you got
    the Greater without the Lesser, one of your qualifying games must not have
    obtained both prizes. Since both prizes are tracked as achievements, you
    can check in-game whether you've earned them by using #achievements.
  </p>
  <h4 id="streaks">How do streaks work?</h4>
  <p>
    A streak is a series of consecutive winning games by the same player.
    Because you can have multiple in-progress games on multiple servers, the
    rule is that the first game started after a win is the candidate for
    continuing a streak. Winning or losing non-candidate games will not affect
    the streak whatsoever. If you start a new game that is eligible to continue
    two or more streaks, it will continue the streak with the earliest overall
    start time.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those familiar with DCSS tournaments, these rules are the same as theirs
    (except that you can play the same race/role as much as you like and it will
    still count towards the streak).
  </p>
  <h4 id="splat">What's a "post-Amulet splat"?</h4>
  <p>
    A "post-Amulet splat" is defined as any game in which the hero possessed the
    Amulet of Yendor, but which did not end in an ascension. Thus, dying is not
    necessary for it to count as a splat.
  </p>
  <h4 id="donation">What's a "successful swap chest donation"?</h4>
  <p>
    A "successful swap chest donation" is an instance of some other player
    removing an item you put into the swap chest.
  </p>
  <h4 id="zscore">What's a "Z-score"?</h4>
  <p>
    A <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Z-score" target="_blank">Z-score</a>
    is a method of ranking a player with multiple ascensions based on the
    diversity of the roles they play. The formula is simple: each ascension in a
    new role is worth 1 point, and repeated ascensions with that same role are
    worth progressively less points: 1/2 for the second, 1/3 for the third, and
    so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compare two players who each ascend 13 games: the first one ascends each
    role once, and so gets a Z-score of 13. The second player, however, ascends
    13 valkyries, and the diminishing returns mean they only get a Z-score of
    3.103.
  </p>
  <h4 id="origins">Why does TNNT exist? What happened to /dev/null?</h4>
  <p>
    The long-running
    <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki//dev/null/nethack_tournament" target="_blank">
      /dev/null/nethack tournament
    </a>
    was unexpectedly shut down in September 2017. When this was announced, some
    players from TeamSplat banded together quickly with the help of the
    hardfought.org server to put together a tribute tournament, which was
    intended to be the same as devnull but updated to 3.6.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tribute tournament was never planned to run for a second year, in order
    to respect the wishes of the devnull organizer, krystal, to have it shut
    down completely and retire its name. Instead, the 2018-era TNNT organizers
    laid plans for a new tournament. Like the tribute, it would be based off
    NetHack 3.6, and would remain a primarily vanilla-like tournament, unlike
    other tournaments like
    <a href="https://junethack.net" target="_blank">Junethack</a>
    which focus on variant play. They also decided to keep the tradition of
    running the tournament for the month of November, when a lot of veteran
    players come out of the woodwork checking to see if there's a tournament.
  </p>
  <h4 id="replacement">So is TNNT the replacement for /dev/null?</h4>
  <p>
    TNNT is <i>not</i> trying to be a replacement for devnull. Per krystal's
    wishes, the devnull name, tournament structure, and game changes have been
    retired. TNNT is a fresh start &mdash; any game changes are based on a clean
    vanilla nethack codebase, and the various components of the tournament were
    designed from scratch. It's a vanilla-adjacent NetHack tournament in
    November, but that's where the similarities end.
  </p>
  <h4 id="devnullchal">What about the devnull challenges?</h4>
  <p>
    As with the rest of devnull, the challenges have been permanently retired
    and are not implemented in TNNT. But TNNT does add some of its own
    challenges, including features that don't exist in any variants. It's a bit
    of a work in progress. We might continue to add new challenges in the
    future.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are looking for the code powering the devnull tribute challenges,
    to use as a patch for your own purposes, you can find the devnull tribute
    scoreboard repo
    <a href="https://github.com/borekl/devnull-tribute-2017" target="_blank">here</a>,
    and the devnull tribute game code
    <a href="https://github.com/NHTangles/NetHack36/tree/devnull_hdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 id="scoring">Why have multiple leaderboards instead of a unified overall score?</h4>
  <p>
    The first three years of TNNT did use a unified score and a single
    leaderboard tracking that score. It started to draw dissatisfaction, though,
    largely because of a number of biases in the scoring algorithm. These biases
    didn't have an obvious solution, because there was simply no way to put an
    objective score on what was ultimately a subjective measure &mdash; how
    impressive a player's games were.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2021, the TNNT website was reimplemented from the ground up, primarily to
    get it written in Python instead of Perl for maintainability reasons. During
    that rewrite, we took the opportunity to implement the multiple-leaderboard
    system, where one's place on each leaderboard is determined by game
    statistics and not a scoring algorithm (and we can show more than just the
    top player in each category). The response has been generally positive, with
    players and clans able to compete in categories they like rather than
    feeling like they need to choose between fun gameplay and doing what would
    earn them the most points.
  </p>
