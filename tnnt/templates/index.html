  <h4> How to Play </h4>
  <p>
    You will need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH" target="_blank">SSH client</a>
    to connect to the game servers. Linux and Mac OS typically come with this
    installed; Windows users can use either a free client like
    <a href="https://putty.org" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> or Windows Subsystem for Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
    TNNT is hosted by <a href="https://www.hardfought.org/nethack" target="_blank">hardfought.org</a>.
    Connect to "nethack@hardfought.org" via SSH, and register an account.
    Then, you can choose any of three servers to play on:
    <ul>
      <li>hardfought.org: USA (East Coast)</li>
      <li>eu.hardfought.org: Europe (London)</li>
      <li>au.hardfought.org: Australia (Sydney)</li>
    </ul>
    Connect to your preferred server the same way via SSH and select the TNNT game
    option. That's all there is to it! If you'd like to play with the TNNT tileset,
    or you're at a location that blocks everything except web access, check out our
    <a href="https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/hterm" target="_blank">hterm</a> page, you can play this way from any of the three
    servers listed above.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create, join, or manage clans, go
    <a href="/clanmgmt">here</a>.
    Clan membership (creating and joining) will be frozen after November 10th!
  </p>

  <!-- was going to put a section for "helpful links" here, but not sure they're needed since the header is pretty obvious -->
