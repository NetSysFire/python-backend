  <h4> How to Play </h4>
  <p>
    TNNT is hosted by
    <a href="https://www.hardfought.org/nethack" target="_blank">hardfought.org</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people play TNNT with an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH" target="_blank">SSH client</a>
    to connect to the game servers. Linux and Mac OS typically come with this
    installed; Windows users can use either a free client like
    <a href="https://putty.org" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> or Windows Subsystem
    for Linux. SSH to "nethack@hardfought.org" or pick an alternate server based
    on whatever's closest to where you are geographically:
    <ul>
      <li>hardfought.org: USA (East Coast)</li>
      <li>eu.hardfought.org: Europe (London)</li>
      <li>au.hardfought.org: Australia (Sydney)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to play with the TNNT tileset, or you're at a location that
    blocks everything except web access, you can also play in a Web browser
    using the
    <a href="https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/hterm" target="_blank">hardfought web terminal</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not already have an account on Hardfought, you need to register
    one first after connecting. Then, select the TNNT game option in the main
    menu after you've logged in. That's all there is to it!
  </p>
  <p>
    To create, join, or manage clans, go
    <a href="/clanmgmt">here</a>.
    Clan membership (creating and joining) will be frozen on November 10th at 00:00 UTC!
