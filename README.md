Rework of the TNNT backend in Python for better maintainability

For development work copy tnnt/settings-clean.py to tnnt/settings.py, then configure
it for your local MySQL database instance. Also add a secret key.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/ has some information about that.
